              <h3>INSECT HOUSE</h3>
             <p>The Insect House offers a close-up look into the miniature world of insects. From fluttering butterflies to marching ants and glowing beetles, this climate-controlled exhibit showcases biodiversity on a tiny scale.</p>
<p>Educational panels, interactive magnifiers, and live demonstrations help visitors understand the vital role insects play in ecosystems—from pollination to decomposition.</p>
<p>Designed with dark zones, lit terrariums, and a butterfly walk-through section, it’s a favorite for young learners and budding entomologists.</p>
<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND IT</p></strong>
<p>The Insect House is located near the Reptile Dome, across from the Pizza Shop.</p>
