              <h3>KOALA</h3>
              <p>The koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) is a tree-dwelling marsupial native to Australia, found primarily in eucalyptus forests along the eastern and southern coasts. Despite being commonly referred to as a "koala bear," it is not a bear but a marsupial, carrying its young in a pouch. Koalas have thick grey fur, large ears, and a distinctive black nose.</p>
<p>Koalas are herbivores and feed almost exclusively on eucalyptus leaves, which are low in nutrients and toxic to many other animals. They sleep up to 20 hours a day to conserve energy. An adult koala can grow to about 85 cm (33 in) and weigh between 4 to 15 kg (9â€“33 lb), depending on the region.</p>
<p>Koalas are solitary animals with strong limbs and sharp claws for climbing. Their populations are declining due to habitat destruction, bushfires, and disease.</p>
<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
<p>You will find the koalas in pen A1, nestled in the Australian Outback section under the eucalyptus canopy.</p>
