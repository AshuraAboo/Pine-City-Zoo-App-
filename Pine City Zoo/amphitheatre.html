              <h3>AMPHITHEATRE</h3>
              <p>The Amphitheatre is the heart of the zoo’s live entertainment. Designed with a natural stage and tiered seating, it offers a comfortable setting for animal demonstrations, educational talks, and interactive performances. Whether it’s learning about raptor flight patterns or enjoying a wildlife-themed puppet show, the Amphitheatre brings fun and learning together for all ages.</p>
<p>Shows are scheduled throughout the day and are often led by expert zookeepers and conservationists who provide unique insight into animal behavior and global conservation efforts. It’s a great place to rest your feet while feeding your curiosity.</p>
<p>The open-air design ensures a connection to nature, and the shaded seating areas make it a perfect pit stop between exhibits.</p>
<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND IT</p></strong>
<p>The Amphitheatre is located near the center of the zoo, just opposite the Elephant enclosure at pen E22.</p>
