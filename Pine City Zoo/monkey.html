              <h3>MONKEY</h3>
            <p>Monkeys are primates of the infraorder Simiiformes, consisting of over 260 species, ranging from small tamarins to large baboons. They are found in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Central and South America. Monkeys are highly intelligent, social animals known for their agility, curiosity, and problem-solving skills.</p>
<p>Monkeys are typically divided into two groups: Old World monkeys, which have narrow noses and live in Africa and Asia, and New World monkeys, with flatter noses, found in the Americas. Their diets vary widely, including fruits, leaves, insects, and sometimes small animals.</p>
<p>Monkeys use complex vocalizations and gestures to communicate. Many species live in large troops with intricate social structures.</p>
