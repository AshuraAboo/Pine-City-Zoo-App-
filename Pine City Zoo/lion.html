              <h3>LION</h3>
             <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is one of the most iconic big cats and is native to Africa and parts of India. Lions are social felines, living in groups called prides, usually led by a dominant male. Male lions are easily recognized by their thick manes, while females are smaller and more agile hunters. Males can weigh up to 225 kg (500 lb) and grow up to 3.3 m (11 ft) in length, including the tail.</p>
<p>Lions are apex predators and feed primarily on large herbivores such as wildebeest, zebras, and buffalo. They are known for their strength, courage, and thunderous roar, which can be heard from up to 8 km (5 miles) away. Lions are most active at night and rest during the day in shaded areas.</p>
<p>Though once widespread, wild lion populations have decreased significantly due to habitat loss and human-wildlife conflict.</p>
<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
<p>You will find the lions at pen S1, in the Big Cat Territory adjacent to the observation cave.</p>
