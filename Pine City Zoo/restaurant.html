              <h3>RESTAURANT</h3>
            <p>The zoo’s full-service Restaurant provides a wide menu for families and groups looking for a hearty meal. With indoor seating and large windows that overlook the giraffe enclosure, it combines good food with a great view.</p>
<p>The menu includes salads, sandwiches, burgers, pasta dishes, and a kids’ corner with animal-shaped meals. Sustainability is key here—leftover food is composted and single-use plastics are minimized.</p>
<p>Perfect for birthday bookings, school trips, or just a mid-day refuel, the Restaurant is the zoo’s main dining hub.</p>
<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND IT</p></strong>
<p>The Restaurant is near the South Gate, close to the gift shop and first aid center.</p>
