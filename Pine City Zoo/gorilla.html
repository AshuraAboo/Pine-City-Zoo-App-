              <h3>GORILLA</h3>
              <p>Gorillas are the largest living primates and belong to the genus Gorilla. Native to the forests of central Sub-Saharan Africa, they are divided into two species—the eastern gorilla and the western gorilla—with several subspecies. Gorillas are ground-dwelling, predominantly herbivorous, and live in social groups called troops led by a dominant silverback male.</p>
<p>They are known for their intelligence, strength, and gentle nature. Adult males can weigh up to 180 kg (400 lb) and reach a height of 1.75 m (5 ft 9 in) when standing. Gorillas communicate using vocalizations, body postures, and facial expressions. They build nests for sleeping and forage for fruits, leaves, and stems during the day.</p>
<p>Despite their strength, gorillas are generally shy and avoid confrontation. Their populations are threatened by habitat loss, disease, and poaching.</p>
<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
<p>You will find the gorillas at pen F3, within the Forest Enclosure near the waterfall feature.</p>
