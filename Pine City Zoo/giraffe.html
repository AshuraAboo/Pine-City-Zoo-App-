              <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
              <p>Giraffes are the tallest living terrestrial animals and the largest ruminants. Belonging to the genus Giraffa, they are native to Africa and typically inhabit savannahs and open woodlands. Traditionally, one species with nine subspecies was recognized, but recent studies suggest several distinct species within the genus. Giraffes are easily recognized by their long necks, long legs, and distinctive coat patterns.</p>
<p>Their long necks enable them to reach leaves and buds in treetops that most other herbivores cannot. Giraffes also have a unique gait and can run at speeds up to 60 km/h (37 mph). Males can reach heights of 5.5 m (18 ft) and weigh up to 1,200 kg (2,600 lb), while females are slightly smaller. Their long, prehensile tongues, measuring around 45 cm (18 in), help them skillfully strip leaves from branches.</p>
<p>Giraffes are social animals, often seen in loosely structured herds. They rely on their excellent eyesight and height to keep watch for predators such as lions. They rarely lie down, instead sleeping standing up or for brief periods while kneeling.</p>
<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
<p>You will find the giraffes at pen S10, near the savannah exhibit and the observation deck.</p>
