              <h3>TIGER</h3>
           <p>The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest species of cat and is native to Asia. Known for its orange coat with black stripes, the tiger is an apex predator that inhabits a variety of ecosystems, including tropical forests, grasslands, and mangroves. Subspecies include the Bengal, Siberian, and Sumatran tigers, each adapted to its specific environment.</p>
<p>Tigers are solitary and territorial animals. Males can weigh up to 300 kg (660 lb) and measure up to 3.3 m (11 ft) in length. They hunt primarily at night, ambushing prey like deer and wild boar. Tigers are strong swimmers and are often found near water sources.</p>
<p>They are endangered due to habitat fragmentation, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict, with fewer than 4,000 left in the wild.</p>
<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
<p>You will find the tigers in pen S2, at the far end of the Predator Zone by the stream bed.</p>
