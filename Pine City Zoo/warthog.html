              <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
          <p>The warthog (Phacochoerus africanus) is a wild member of the pig family found in grassland, savannah, and woodland in Sub-Saharan Africa. Warthogs are recognizable by their large tusks, warty facial pads, and sparse mane of coarse hair. Despite their rugged look, they are agile runners and excellent diggers.</p>
<p>Warthogs primarily feed on grasses, roots, and tubers, often kneeling on their front legs to dig or graze. They use their burrows for protection, often backing in to face outward in case of predators. Warthogs live in small family groups called sounders and have a range of vocalizations for communication.</p>
<p>They play an important role in maintaining healthy grassland ecosystems.</p>
<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
<p>You will find the warthogs at pen G7, near the Savannah Circle lookout point.</p>
