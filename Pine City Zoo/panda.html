              <h3>PANDA</h3>
           <p>The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) is a bear species native to the mountain ranges of central China. It is known for its distinctive black-and-white fur and love of bamboo. Adult pandas can weigh up to 160 kg (350 lb) and are solitary animals that spend most of their time feeding and resting.</p>
<p>Though classified as carnivores, pandas are almost entirely herbivorous, with bamboo making up over 99% of their diet. They have a specially adapted wrist bone that acts like a thumb to grasp bamboo stalks. Pandas are gentle and shy, rarely aggressive unless provoked.</p>
<p>Once on the brink of extinction, panda populations have rebounded due to dedicated conservation efforts, although they remain vulnerable.</p>
<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
<p>You will find the pandas in pen C6, in the Bamboo Garden habitat beside the tranquility pond.</p>
