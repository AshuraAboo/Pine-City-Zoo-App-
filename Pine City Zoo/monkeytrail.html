              <h3>MONKEY TRAIL</h3>
            <p>The Monkey Trail is a raised, winding path that gives visitors an up-close view of our most playful residents. From lemurs to capuchins, the trail is filled with climbing ropes, swinging vines, and monkey bridges above and around the walkway.</p>
<p>Each section is themed by speciesâ€™ native regions, with interactive signs that teach visitors about primate behavior, habitats, and conservation efforts. Watch monkeys leap from platform to platform or forage for hidden snacks as part of their enrichment activities.</p>
<p>The immersive design encourages observation and wonder, especially among younger guests.</p>
<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND IT</p></strong>
<p>The Monkey Trail begins at Station M4 and loops around the upper northeast side of the zoo.</p>
