              <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
              <p>The gemsbok (Oryx gazella) is a large antelope species native to arid regions of Southern Africa, including the Kalahari Desert. It is known for its striking appearance, with long, straight horns, black-and-white facial markings, and a sleek greyish-tan body. Both males and females possess horns, which can reach lengths of up to 85 cm (33 in) and are used for defense and dominance contests.</p>
<p>Gemsbok are well adapted to desert environments, capable of surviving without surface water for long periods by obtaining moisture from the plants they consume. They are herbivores and graze on grasses, leaves, and roots. These antelopes are highly territorial and often live in small herds. They rely on their sharp senses and speed to avoid predators.</p>
<p>The gemsbokâ€™s resilience and unique beauty make it a symbol of strength in harsh climates. Its distinct markings and majestic horns are key identifiers.</p>
<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
<p>You will find the gemsbok in pen D5, along the Desert Loop Trail.</p>
