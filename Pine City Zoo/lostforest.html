              <h3>LOST FOREST</h3>
             <p>The Lost Forest is a lush, winding pathway surrounded by tall trees, dense vegetation, and hidden animal sculptures. It’s a peaceful zone designed to replicate a temperate forest biome, complete with misty corners and birdsong playing through hidden speakers.</p>
<p>It encourages mindful exploration, perfect for visitors who want a quiet nature walk away from the more crowded animal exhibits. Interpretive signs offer forest facts and scavenger hunt clues for kids.</p>
<p>It’s also home to a few secret surprises—including a fairy door trail and a hidden viewpoint over the zoo’s wetlands.</p>
<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND IT</p></strong>
<p>You can access the Lost Forest from the west side of the zoo, behind the Amphitheatre and next to the Coffee Shop.</p>
